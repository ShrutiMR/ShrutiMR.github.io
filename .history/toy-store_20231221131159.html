							<h2>Toy Store<br/></h2>
						</header>
						<p>Implemented a multi-tiered toy store as microservices by using socket-programming for communication among various services and for communication between the client and the Front-end service. The front-end service is an interface which connects the client to the microservices - catalog and order. The catalog service has a json file which acts as a database file containing a list of toys, their price, and quantity. The Catalog service can either receive a Query or Update request. The order service has a csv file which stores the order number for all the orders. The client communicates with the Front-end service to either Get the product information or to initiate a Buy request. Finally, each of these services are dockerized and are deployed in AWS cloud.  </p>
